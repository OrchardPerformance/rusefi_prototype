980140 - The Comparison of Mass Fraction Burned
Obtained from the Cylinder Pressure Signal and
Spark Plug Ion Signal - Very useful 

For many years at Champion, spark plug ion sensing has
been used to detect engine pre-ignition in order to select
the proper heat range spark plug for an engine. In recent
years, ion sensing again became a topic of interest due
to its increasing applications in engine diagnostic and
engine control, such as misfire and knock detection;
spark timing control; A/F ratio detection and even pressure estimation (Eriksson, et al. 1996, 1997; Satizkoff, et
al. 1996, 1997). 

 Figure 1 shows a typical ionization signal obtained through a spark plug. As has been
discussed in much of the literature, the first peak of this
signal is the result of ignition pulse. The second peak is
the flame front passing through the gap. The third peak,
which has been called postflame by many researchers,
usually correlates well with the pressure signal and can
be used to interpret the peak pressure location for spark
timing control (Eriksson, Nielsen, and Glavenius, 1997)
and gas temperature sensing around the spark gap
(Satizkoff, 1997). After the third peak, the ion signal follows the pressure signal but declines more rapidly to a
lower value.
