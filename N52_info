Cams can be made to swap from N52 to other engines, see N52 exhaust cam in N55. Suspect N/S55 intake cam could be made to work on N52.
GID engine has pump driven by timing chain so no difference in the rear end of the cams. 

Water pump is a pierburg pump, can be made to work with a simple PWM.

Some flywheels/later trans has spigot bearing in gearbox not crank. N52 expected to be in crank.
